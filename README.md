## Introduction

Placeholder Forge is a tool created for developers and designers who need placeholder images for their products on online markets. Many online platforms restrict the use of dummy or real images, making it challenging to showcase products effectively. Placeholder Forge provides a simple solution to this problem.

Visit [https://placeholderforge.github.io/](https://placeholderforge.github.io/) to use the service.

1. **Visit the Website:**
   Navigate to [https://placeholderforge.github.io/](https://placeholderforge.github.io/) in your web browser.

2. **Upload Your Images:**
   Upload the images for which you need placeholders. The tool supports various image formats.

3. **Generate and Download Placeholder Images:**
   Once you've uploaded your images, click the "Generate and Download Zip" button. The tool will instantly process your images and start the download of a zip file containing all the placeholder images.

4. **Usage:**
   Once the download is complete, unzip the file and use the placeholder images in your projects. This allows you to maintain consistent dimensions without revealing the actual content.
